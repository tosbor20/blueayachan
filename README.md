### What is this?
I forked Electra's blueayachan bot and made it for my stupid idol obsession

### Features!
* High speed "SFW" image scraping from Danbooru (Now with 100% more sauce!)
* User's can choose to omit commands they don't want to have in their channel (will eventually allow for this to be done in IRC)
* User level ability to add and remove their own channels to and from the bot with a single command (you don't have to ask me to add you!)

### Special Thanks
It's pretty obvious, but this project was heavily inspired by bots that came before it.
* Botwoon by Dessyreqt
* FUNtoon by Taw_
* ZeppyZ by Kuribon
* Frigbot by Flameberger
* Blueayachan by Electra_RTA (Who I pretty much just stole the code from)

These bots have all entertained me immensely over the years and I am very thankful to their creator's hard work to make such simple programs create such engaging user experiences.

### Contribution
Now that this has a repo I suppose I should actually clean up the codebase a bit and create some style guidelines. I will eventually get around to doing this as well as a detailed explanation of the file parsing formats and such. If you would like to help with the bot feel free to reach out and I'll start getting something together.

### Forking
As this is Free Software, feel free to fork this repository and use the code to write your own bot. (Obviously you will have to do heavy modification since you can't use the credentials I use for my own bot)
